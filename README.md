# network-simulator
## Intro/context
I just got the idea of trying to create a program that could help simulate networks on all levels
(physical, link, etc.), and created this repo in anticipation.\
If done right, I should be able to simulate for anything, and all protocols, with the
ability to controll all parameters.
It's mostly just an idea for now though, I don't know if I'll actually pursue it. If I do and the
standard protocols are too complex to implement - or if the specifications are not accessible
enough -, maybe I could try to create my own protocols.

## Purpose
Mostly for fun/curiosity/coding practice
